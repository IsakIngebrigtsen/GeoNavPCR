# GeoNavPCR: Using point cloud registration algorithms to improve the navigation solutions of mobile mapping vehicles. 

## Introduction

This GitHub page is consisting of the code that lays the basis for the master thesis: Using point Cloud registration to improve a navigation solution: an experimental approach.

Taken from the thesis to establish context for the code:

"The first concept is to analyse if PCR can be used to align the target and source point cloud and improve the initial navigation solution by collecting the processed point at a given timestamp after the alignment. For the analysis, the target point cloud’s absolute position is also processed to high absolute accuracy, however, this is only used to compare the processed results." 

"The second concept concerns how the NMA wants to establish a quality measure of a mobile mapping project by analysing the quality of the navigation solution. If the absolute accuracy of the mobile mapping project is unknown, how can the navigation solution’s quality be assessed?"


The goal of the thesis has been to establish a consistent way of using point cloud registration to establish an absolute position by aligning it with a georeferenced point cloud.

Furthermore, the following are the research questions that are used in the thesis:

*Can PCR improve the absolute accuracy of a mobile mapping LiDAR point cloud by aligning it with a georeferenced point cloud? 

*Can a predicted trajectory from PCR be used as a viable quality measure of a navigation solution?
